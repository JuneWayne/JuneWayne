## Hi!ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± This is **Ethan**, a third year student in the `B.S. in Data Science program` at the University of Virginia School of Data Science!
- ðŸ”­ I have a strong interest Multi-modal, Multi-Agent, RAG-based, fully-automated chatbots, namely its applications in enterprise environments
- âš¡ I am also a big fan of building sustainable data pipeline systems that extracts, transforms, and load quality and abundant volume of data to support prominent ML and real time data analytics tasks (This has proven to be extremely necessary within my own project explorations)
- ðŸ¤” Not to mention my continued passion and exploration into the application of ML and predictive analytics in client projects and real-life scenarios
- ðŸ˜­ Last summer I was an AI & Automations Intern at Align Tech, actively open to **internship opportunities for the summer of 2026**

**I have four major projects pinned down below:**
- `CavHires:` A website born in the 2025 Hoo Hacks Hackathon aimed to promote real time Campus Part-time jobs to UVA students.
- `Active Learning Lab Website:` A project underneath the Lab led by Prof.Wright to collect job market data & creating a website that allows for real time updates in the Data Science Job Market.
- `PARCtorch:` A to-be published PyTorch library that implements the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network that could effectively predict & simulate physics simulations. I worked on the training and model design of the PARC neural network for ShearFlow Fluid Dynamics.
- `Agents Playground:` A project from McIntire to research into the realm of Agentic AI, seeking ways to optimize RAG, multi-Agent, and multi-modal chatbot systems for better user experience in market research efforts

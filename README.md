## Hi!👋
- 🌱 This is **Ethan**, a third year student in the `B.S. in Data Science program` at the University of Virginia School of Data Science!
- 🔭 I have a strong interest in Mechanistic Interpretability Research, specifically in the realm of AI Alignment and BlackBox Understanding of frontier models
- 🤔 Currently, I am researcher at **Spatial AI Lab** led by Dr.Lei Li on Mechanistic Interpretability for 3D Genernative Models, specifically, interpreting Autoregressive 3D Mesh Generation Models.
- 😶‍🌫️ Last summer I was an AI & Automations Intern at Align Tech, next summer I am an incoming Data Science Intern at Cisco Systems.
- 📫 How to reach me: wkt7ne@virginia.edu

**I have several major projects pinned down below:**
- `Latent Space Representation of Job Functions` A project continuing from the Active Learning Lab to map Job descriptions to latent space embeddings and cluster them to extract findings about the data science Job Market. (Led by Dr.Brian Wright and Ali Rivera)
- `Job-Market-Stream` A real-time data science internship streaming platform that acquires data about real-time job market updates
- `Active Learning Lab Website:` A project underneath the Lab led by Prof.Wright to collect job market data & creating a website that allows for real time updates in the Data Science Job Market.
- `PARCtorch:` A to-be published PyTorch library that implements the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network that could effectively predict & simulate physics simulations. I worked on the training and model design of the PARC neural network for ShearFlow Fluid Dynamics.
- `Agents Playground:` A project from McIntire to research into the realm of Agentic AI, seeking ways to optimize RAG, multi-Agent, and multi-modal chatbot systems for better user experience in market research efforts

## Hi!👋
- 🌱 This is **Ethan**, a third year student in the `B.S. in Data Science program` at the University of Virginia School of Data Science!
- 🔭 I have a strong interest Multi-modal, Multi-Agent, RAG-based, fully-automated chatbots, namely its applications in enterprise environments
- ⚡ I am also a big fan of building sustainable data pipeline systems that extracts, transforms, and load quality and abundant volume of data to support prominent ML and real time data analytics tasks (This has proven to be extremely necessary within my own project explorations)
- 🤔 Currently a researcher at Spatial AI Lab led by Dr.Lei Li on Mechanistic Interpretability for 3D Genernative Models
- 😭 Last summer I was an AI & Automations Intern at Align Tech, incoming at Cisco Systems as a Data Science Intern
- 📫 How to reach me: wkt7ne@virginia.edu

**I have several major projects pinned down below:**
- `Latent Space Representation of Job Functions` A project continuing from the Active Learning Lab to map Job descriptions to latent space embeddings and cluster them to extract findings about the data science Job Market. (Led by Dr.Brian Wright and Ali Rivera)
- `Job-Market-Stream` A real-time data science internship streaming platform that acquires data about real-time job market updates
- `Active Learning Lab Website:` A project underneath the Lab led by Prof.Wright to collect job market data & creating a website that allows for real time updates in the Data Science Job Market.
- `PARCtorch:` A to-be published PyTorch library that implements the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network that could effectively predict & simulate physics simulations. I worked on the training and model design of the PARC neural network for ShearFlow Fluid Dynamics.
- `Agents Playground:` A project from McIntire to research into the realm of Agentic AI, seeking ways to optimize RAG, multi-Agent, and multi-modal chatbot systems for better user experience in market research efforts
